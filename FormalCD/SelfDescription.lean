# Bounded syntactic self-description

SoSyM §6.1.3 / Figure 21c says MCD is itself a formal CD. The checked statement
here means representation in the same `CDOver` family as ordinary formal CDs
and Figure 21b. It does not mean that MCD satisfies itself as a semantic instance.
All six syntax/registry universes below are zero; the signature is the built-in
vocabulary extended by nd/ad and the registry is the existing SING registry.
Class, Map and Signature are ordinary `Metamodel.Node` constructors. Full graph
bindings use the existing equivalence, including isolated vertices and zero-arrow
arities. No claim about literal-key or total-args satisfaction follows.
