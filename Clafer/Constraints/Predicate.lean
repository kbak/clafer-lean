# Meanings of source-constraint symbols

SoSyM §6.2.2, Appendix D.4 and B.5. A predicate interprets its complete
support diagram and universally closes the explicitly supplied external domains.
The primitive realization is fixed independently of truth. Invalid support
diagrams, undefined operations and defined false bodies do not satisfy it.

does not select a domain or authorize an arbitrary choice of one. -/
