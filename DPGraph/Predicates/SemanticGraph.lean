# A bounded semantic graph of sets and mappings

SoSyM §6.1.1 (PDF pp.18–19), A.1/B.1 (PDF pp.28–30), B.4 Definition 6.
Vertices are subsets of one ambient U, so shared objects retain their identity.
For U : Type u and a bound w, links live in Type (max u w), vertices in Type u
and arrows in Type (max u w + 1). This is a quiver, with no category instance
on span arrows and no assertion of an all-universes SetMap.
